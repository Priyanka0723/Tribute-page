                <div class="element"><h2>A Tribute to a Brilliant Mind</h2>
                    <p>Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who left an indelible mark on the world of science. Despite facing immense physical challenges due to a motor neuron disease, he made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of the universe. Let's delve into the life and achievements of this extraordinary individual.</p></div>
                
                <div class="element"><h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                    <p>Stephen William Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England. From a young age, he displayed a keen interest in mathematics and science. He studied physics at University College, Oxford, and later pursued his Ph.D. in cosmology at the University of Cambridge.</p></div>
                
                
                <div class="element"><h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
                <h3>Black Hole Theory</h3>
                <p>Hawking's most famous work centered around black holes. In 1974, he proposed the concept of Hawking radiation, which suggested that black holes emit radiation and can eventually evaporate. This groundbreaking idea challenged conventional wisdom and had profound implications for our understanding of the universe's evolution.
                </p>
                <h3>Cosmology and the Big Bang Theory</h3>
                <p>Hawking made significant contributions to cosmology, particularly in the study of the origins and structure of the universe. His research helped refine the Big Bang theory and shed light on fundamental questions about the nature of time, space, and the cosmos.</p>
                <h3>Theoretical Physics</h3>
                <p>Throughout his career, Hawking delved into various aspects of theoretical physics, including quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the nature of gravity. His work provided valuable insights into the fundamental forces that govern the universe.</p>
